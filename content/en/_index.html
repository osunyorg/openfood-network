            <p>For years I have been writing about the need for a fairer, more sustainable food distribution system.  It appears that we now have it.  The online, open source, not-for-profit Open Food Network is owned and controlled by the people who grow, rear, process and eat the food.  It is providing a growing Network of food and drink producers and small-scale retailers with a rich variety of routes to market that enable transparency for the shoppers and buyers along with maximum returns to the people who are producing our food.  Are supermarkets’ days numbered?</p>
