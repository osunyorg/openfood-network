<p>Jo has been a member of the OFN UK team since April 2020, when the first Covid lockdown increased OFN UK sales by 800 % and she joined as a volunteer. As part of the UK instance, she helps new enterprises set up on the platform and is leading the Resilient Green Spaces project; a £1.27m partnership project piloting alternative and re-localised food systems in Wales. Jo lives on the south coast of England with her partner and two children.</p>
